# Interview CheatMate

**Your Secret Weapon for Interview Success**

## Overview

Interview CheatMate is an innovative tool designed to assist users in preparing for interviews by leveraging advanced AI models and technologies. It facilitates seamless, real-time conversations on a web-based platform, analyzes user queries, and provides targeted assistance through state-of-the-art natural language processing and agent-based decision-making systems.

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Conversational Interface

- Users can engage in natural conversations directly on a user-friendly Streamlit-based website.

### 2. Speech-to-Text Conversion

- Groq Whisper API is utilized to convert spoken interactions into text, which is stored in a buffer for further processing.

### 3. AI-Powered Question Analysis

- When a user requests help, Groq's Llama LLM analyzes the text buffer to extract the most relevant question based on the context of the conversation.

### 4. Intelligent Agent Designation

- The extracted question is processed by Crew AIâ€™s agentic models, which include:
  - **Designator Agent**: Determines whether to route the query to:
    - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: For personalized or document-based searches.
    - **Web Agent**: For tasks requiring web-based information retrieval.
    - **Direct LLM Response**: For straightforward general inquiries.

### 5. Advanced Retrieval Mechanisms

- **RAG Workflows**:
  - Semantic search powered by Pinecone vector database.
  - Sentence-transformer embeddings using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.
  - PDF content extraction facilitated by PyMuPDF.
  - Orchestration and integration via LangChain.

### 6. Web Search Integration

- Serper API enables robust web search capabilities to address information needs beyond local data.

### 7. Response Presentation

- Results are displayed in real-time on the website, ensuring users receive actionable insights promptly.
